## How to Run

You can click on the most recent release under Releases and download 'downloader.exe' from there. Once downloaded, clicking on the executable should run the program. 

If you choose to clone the repo, you can also run the program by navigating to the root directory of this project (YouTube-MP3-Downloader) and running 'py downloader.py' in a terminal where Python is installed.

## How to Use

1. Paste your YouTube URL into the first entry box
    - Note that this should be the URL in the search bar above the video, not the one you get from right-clicking the video itself
2. Type in what you want the filename to be (i.e. Siren)
    - Avoid using any special characters
3. Click the folder button and select a folder you want to download into
4. Click the download button
